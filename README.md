# Collegialiteit meter / Collegiality meter

### What does this app do?
This app counts up the points you received from doing certain tasks at your workplace, the more points you receive, the better!

### What is the point in using this?
 It's a way for you and your colleagues to compete in being a nicer person at work, or doing more tasks, or you name it!
 The colleague of the month can be decided thanks to this system, or any other reward system used in your cooperation!

### How to use the app?
- Insert a value between -1000 and 1000 points.
- Give a reason for the points to gifted to you.
- Press "Voeg toe".
- And you are done!

I am open for any feedback!
